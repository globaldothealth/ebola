# Ebola data Uganda outbreak 2022

This repository contains dated records of curated Ebola cases from the 2022 outbreak in Uganda. Data are curated from openly accessible sources. We continue to experience ongoing challenges in data curation, discussed below. Line-list data may change due to ongoing data reconciliation and validation. 

## Data curation
This section is an overview of the data curation process, a discussion about limitations and assumptions.

Curation, especially early in the outbreak, is a manual, labor-intensive process. We experience many recurring challenges in building an emerging disease dataset in real-time.

The Ebola line-list is built from a collection of sources, listed here, which will be updated as new sources become available: https://github.com/globaldothealth/ebola/wiki. The original source(s) of information is provided for each line-list ID in our database. The WHO provides Situation Reports (SitReps) from the Uganda Ministry of Health; while not available from the start of the outbreak, these resources have become a primary source for information. However, we remain limited by inconsistent, aggregated, or missing case information; change in reporting format; data reconciliation; conflicting details; confusing statements; reporting delays. We frequently observe conflicting data and details between sources, and even within a single report. We have not outlined the specific challenges or discrepancies for each [SitRep](https://www.afro.who.int/countries/publications?country=879), but can discuss further as needed.

Reports from government/official sources can be enriched with supplemental information retrieved from local reporting (including media) or other sources. Metadata are added at any time, as information becomes available and our time and resources permit. After making changes, the case will be recorded as modified with the date. Multiple curators look at each datapoint and any discrepancies are resolved in conversations between them. Assumptions are made that may compromise the accuracy of the data. 

Users should refer to our Data Dictionary for a description of each variable. Assumptions for select variables are briefly discussed below.

**Case_status**: Only confirmed and probable cases are logged at this time. 

**Date_of_onset**: Information is only available for probable cases; we are unable to disaggregate Date_of_onset details for confirmed cases.  

**Date_confirmation**: The report date is used when a Date_confirmation is not specified by source.

**Outcome**. Type: Death: The report date is used when a Date_death is not specified by source. If the number of deaths exceeds the number of new cases reported for that day, then deaths are logged under a previous ID with unassigned outcome and corresponding location information, when available.

**Outcome**. Type: Recovery: When a recovery is reported, the recovery is assigned to a previous ID with unassigned outcome and corresponding location information, when available.

**Healthcare_worker**: Healthcare worker information (e.g. location, date_confirmation, outcome) is not consistently provided by source. Supplemental sources are used, when available, to gain context that may help us to assign an ID. However, due to the limited availability of information, we have not been able to log every confirmed HCW case or outcome. 

Data are hand-curated. The process and methods to create, organize, and maintain data have been applied with consistency; however, weâ€™re human and mistakes happen. As stated above, line-list data may change due to ongoing data reconciliation and validation. We welcome your contributions and feedback. Get involved!
